    * **Deprecation Notice:** GitHub will discontinue the [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations/), which is used by integrations to create personal access tokens and OAuth tokens, and you must now create these tokens using our [web application flow](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#web-application-flow). The [OAuth Authorizations API](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations) will be removed on November, 13, 2020. For more information, including scheduled brownouts, see the [blog post](https://developer.github.com/changes/2020-02-14-deprecating-oauth-auth-endpoint/).
    *
    * If you have two-factor authentication setup, Basic Authentication for this endpoint requires that you use a one-time password (OTP) and your username and password instead of tokens. For more information, see "[Working with two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/other-authentication-methods#working-with-two-factor-authentication)."
    *
    * You can only send one of these scope keys at a time.
    *
    * FROM: <https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/oauth-authorizations#update-an-existing-authorization>
    *
    * **Parameters:**
    *
    * * `authorization_id: i64` -- authorization_id parameter.
