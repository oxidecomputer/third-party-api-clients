    * Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository.
    *
    * This function performs a `DELETE` to the `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/analyses/{analysis_id}` endpoint.
    *
    * Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository. For
    * private repositories, you must use an access token with the `repo` scope. For public repositories,
    * you must use an access token with `public_repo` and `repo:security_events` scopes.
    * GitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.
    *
    * You can delete one analysis at a time.
    * To delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.
    * Conceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.
    *
    * When you list the analyses for a repository,
    * one or more will be identified as deletable in the response:
    *
    * ```
    * "deletable": true
    * ```
    *
    * An analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.
    * Typically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses
    * for each enabled code scanning tool,
    * where a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:
    *
    * * `ref`
    * * `tool`
    * * `analysis_key`
    * * `environment`
    *
    * If you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,
    * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
    *
    * ```
    * Analysis specified is not deletable.
    * ```
    *
    * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
    * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set
    * (see the example default response below).
    * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
    * in the set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
    * for the specified tool in your repository.
    * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
    * When you delete the last analysis in a set the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
    * in the 200 response is `null`.
    *
    * As an example of the deletion process,
    * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
    * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
    * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
    * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
    * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
    * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
    * To start, you must find the deletable analysis for one of the sets,
    * step through deleting the analyses in that set,
    * and then repeat the process for the second set.
    * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
    *
    * **Outer loop**:
    * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
    * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
    *
    *   **Inner loop**:
    *   * Delete the identified analysis.
    *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
    *
    * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

If you attempt to delete the final analysis in a set without setting this parameter to `true`, you'll get a 400 response with the message: `Analysis is last of its type and deletion may result in the loss of historical alert data.

    * Upload an analysis as SARIF data.
    *
    * This function performs a `POST` to the `/repos/{owner}/{repo}/code-scanning/sarifs` endpoint.

    *
    * There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
    *  - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."
    *  - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."
    *
    * You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:
    *
    * ```
    * gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0
    * ```
    *
    * SARIF upload supports a maximum of 5000 results per analysis run. Any results over this limit are ignored and any SARIF uploads with more than 25,000 results are rejected. Typically, but not necessarily, a SARIF file contains a single run of a single tool. If a code scanning tool generates too many results, you should update the analysis configuration to run only the most important rules or queries.
    *
    * The `202 Accepted`, response includes an `id` value.
    * You can use this ID to check the status of the upload by using this for the `/sarifs/{sarif_id}` endpoint.
    * For more information, see "[Get information about a SARIF upload](/rest/reference/code-scanning#get-information-about-a-sarif-upload)."
