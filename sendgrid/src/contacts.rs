     * If the contact already exists in the system, any entries submitted via this endpoint will update the existing contact. The contact to update will be determined only by the `email` field and any fields omitted from the request will remain as they were. A contact's ID cannot be used to update the contact.

     * The email field will be changed to all lower-case. If a contact is added with an email that exists but contains capital letters, the existing contact with the all lower-case email will be updated.
