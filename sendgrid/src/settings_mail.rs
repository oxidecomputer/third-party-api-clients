To remove one or more `list` entries, pass a `list` with only the entries you wish to retain.

     * You should not add generic domains such as `gmail.com` or `yahoo.com`  in your `list` because your emails will not honor recipients' unsubscribes. This may cause a legal violation of [CAN-SPAM](https://sendgrid.com/docs/glossary/can-spam/) and could damage your sending reputation.
