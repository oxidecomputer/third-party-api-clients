     * Returns a URL to the recipient view UI.
     *
     * This function performs a `POST` to the `/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/views/recipient` endpoint.
     *
     * Returns a URL that enables you to embed the recipient view of the DocuSign UI in your applications. If the recipient is a signer, then the view will provide the signing ceremony.
     *
     * **Note**: Please redirect the client to the URL. iFrames should not be used, especially if the recipient is using a mobile or tablet.
     *
     * This method is only used with envelopes in the `sent` status.
     *
     * Your application is responsible for authenticating the identity of the recipient or signer when you use this method. Use the parameters `assertionId`, `authenticationInstant`, `authenticationMethod`, `clientUserId`, and `securityDomain` to record information on how the recipient was authenticated. At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId` are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope's certificate of completion.
     *
     * ## Redirects
     * After the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user's browser back to your app via the `returnUrl` that you supply. (The user is redirected through a different subdomain, depending on the region of the account sending the envelope. Please [verify your domain whitelist](https://www.docusign.com/trust/security/whitelists).)
     *
     * ### The event status parameter
     * DocuSign appends an `event` query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app can use this event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Do not fetch the envelope status by using Envelopes::get or a similar method because doing so could break the DocuSign rule against polling.
     *
     * **Note**: Because a user can cancel redirection, close their browser after signing, or spoof the landing URL. Hitting the `ReturnUrl` should not be the single source of truth for envelope status for your integration.
     *
     * ## The URL is time-limited
     * The URL returned by this method is valid for one use, and you must use or display it within a couple of minutes after it is generated. AFter the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.
     *
     * Because the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent through email. After you receive it, immediately redirect the user's browser to the URL.
     *
     * If you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation's URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.
     *
     * ## Maintaining State
     * After the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the `returnUrl` field. Eg, `https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the user is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will be appended. In this example, prevent spoofing by not using a guessable value as the state value.
     *
     * **Note**: You can revoke the URL by making the DELETE call to the same URL with no request body.
     *
     * **Parameters:**
     *
     * * `account_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
     * * `envelope_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
