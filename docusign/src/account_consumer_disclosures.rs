     * Updates the Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure for an account.
     *
     * This function performs a `PUT` to the `/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/consumer_disclosure/{langCode}` endpoint.
     *
     * Account administrators can use this method to perform the following tasks:
     *
     * - Customize values in the default disclosure.
     * - Switch to a custom disclosure that uses your own text and HTML formatting.
     * - Change values in your existing consumer disclosure.
     *
     * To specify the signer language version of the disclosure that you are updating, use the optional `langCode` query parameter.
     *
     * **Note**: Only account administrators can use this method. Each time you change the disclosure content, all unsigned recipients of outstanding documents will be required to accept a new version.
     *
     * ## Updating the default disclosure
     *
     * When you update the default disclosure, you can edit all properties except for the following ones:
     *
     * - `accountEsignId`: This property is read only.
     * - `custom`: The default value is **false**. Editing this property causes the default disclosure to switch to a custom disclosure.
     * - `esignAgreement`: This property is read only.
     * - `esignText`: You cannot edit this property when `custom` is set to **false**. The API returns a 200 OK HTTP response, but does not update the `esignText`.
     * - Metadata properties: These properties are read only.
     *
     * **Note**: The text of the default disclosure is always in English.
     *
     * ## Switching to a custom disclosure
     *
     * To switch to a custom disclosure, set the `custom` property to **true** and customize the value for the `eSignText` property.
     *
     * You can also edit all of the other properties except for the following ones:
     *
     * - `accountEsignId`: This property is read only.
     * - `esignAgreement`: This property is read only.
     * - Metadata properties: These properties are read only.
     *
     * **Note**: When you use a custom disclosure, you can create versions of it in different signer languages and se the `langCode` parameter to specify the signer language version that you are updating.
     *
     * **Important**:  When you switch from a default to a custom disclosure, note the following information:
     *
     * - You will not be able to return to using the default disclosure.
     * - Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom disclosure. You must create a disclosure for each language that your signers use.
     *
     * ## Updating a custom disclosure
     *
     * When you update a custom disclosure, you can update all of the properties except for the following ones:
     *
     * - `accountEsignId`: This property is read only.
     * - `esignAgreement`: This property is read only.
     * - Metadata properties: These properties are read only.
     *
     * **Important**: Only the disclosure for the currently selected signer language is saved. DocuSign will not automatically translate your custom disclosure. You must create a disclosure for each language that your signers use.
