    * Returns document visibility for a recipient.

    *
    * This method returns information about document visibility for a recipient.
    *
    * **Parameters:**
    *
    * * `account_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
    * * `envelope_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
    * * `recipient_id: &str` -- A local reference that senders use to map recipients to other objects, such as specific document tabs. Within an envelope, each `recipientId` must be unique, but there is no uniqueness requirement across envelopes. For example, many envelopes assign the first recipient a `recipientId` of `1`.
