     *
     * Updates the recipients of a draft envelope or corrects recipient information for an in-process envelope.
     *
     * If you send information for a recipient that does not already exist in a draft envelope, the recipient is added to the envelope (similar to the EnvelopeRecipients::Create method).
     *
     * You can also use this method to resend an envelope to a recipient by using the `resend_envelope` option.
     *
     * **Updating Sent Envelopes**
     *
     * After an envelope has been sent, you can edit only the following properties:
     *
     * - `accessCode`
     * - `agentCanEditName`
     * - `agentCanEditEmail`
     * - `customFields`
     * - `deliveryMethod`
     * - `documentVisibility`
     * - `email`
     * - `emailNotification`
     * - `idCheckConfigurationName`
     * - `name`
     * - `note`
     * - `phoneAuthentication`
     * - `recipientType` (For this to work, you must also change the recipient object to match the recipient type.)
     * - `requireIdLookup`
     * - `routingOrder`
     * - `routingOrder`
     * - `signingGroupId` (You can change this id to switch to a different signing group and its corresponding set of recipients.)
     * - `smsAuthentication`
     * - `suppressEmails`
     * - `userName`
     *

     * * `envelope_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
     * * `combine_same_order_recipients: &str` -- When set to **true**, recipients are combined or merged with matching recipients. Recipient matching occurs as part of [template matching](https://docs.docusign.com/DocuSignHelp/Content/automatic-template-matching.htm), and is based on Recipient Role and Routing Order.
     * * `offline_signing: &str` -- Indicates if offline signing is enabled for the recipient when a network connection is unavailable. .
     * * `resend_envelope: &str` -- When set to **true**, resends the   envelope if the new recipient's routing order is before or the same as the envelope's next recipient.
