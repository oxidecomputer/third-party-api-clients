    /**
     * Creates a bulk send test.
     *
     * This function performs a `POST` to the `/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/bulk_send_lists/{bulkSendListId}/test` endpoint.
     *
     * This method tests a bulk send list for compatibility with the envelope or template that you want to send. For example, a template that has three roles is not compatible with a bulk send list that has only two recipients. For this reason, you might want to test compatibility first.
     *
     * A successful test result returns `true` for the `canBeSent` property. An unsuccessful test returns a JSON response that contains information about the errors that occurred.
     *
     * If the test is successful, you can then send the envelope or template by using the [BulkSend::createBulkSendRequest][BulkSendRequest] method.
     *
     * ## Envelope Compatibility Checks
     *
     * This section describes the envelope compatibility checks that the system performs.
     *
     * **Top-Level Issues**
     *
     * - Envelopes must be in a sendable state.
     * - The bulk send list must contain at least one copy (instance of an envelope), and no more than the maximum number of copies allowed for the account.
     * - The envelope must not be null and must be visible to the current user.
     * - The account cannot have more queued envelopes than the maximum number configured for the account.
     * - The bulk send list must exist.
     *
     * **Recipients**
     *
     * - The envelope must have recipients.
     * - If you are using an envelope, all of the recipients defined in the bulk send list must have corresponding recipient IDs in the envelope definition. If you are using a template, you must either match the recipient IDs or role IDs.
     * - The envelope cannot contain a bulk recipient (an artifact of the legacy version of DocuSign's bulk send
     *   functionality).
     *
     * **Recipient Tabs**
     *
     * - Every `recipient ID, tab label` pair in the bulk send list must correspond to a tab in the envelope.
     *
     * **Custom Fields**
     *
     * - Each envelope-level custom field in the bulk send list must correspond to the name of a `customField` in the
     *   envelope definition. You do not have to match the recipient-level custom fields.
     *

     *
     *
     *
     *
     * **Parameters:**
     *
     * * `account_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
     * * `bulk_send_list_id: &str` -- The GUID of the bulk send list. This property is created after you post a new bulk send list.
