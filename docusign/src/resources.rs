     * Lists resources for REST version specified.

     * This function performs a `GET` to the `/v2.1` endpoint.
     *
     * Retrieves the base resources available for the DocuSign REST APIs.
     *
     * You do not need an integrator key to view the REST API versions and resources.
     *
     * Example: https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/v2 lists all of the base resources available in version 2 of the REST API on the DocuSign Demo system.
     *
     * To view descriptions and samples of the service operations for all versions, remove the version number and add /help to the URL.
     *
     * Example: https://demo.docusign.net/restapi/help lists the REST API operations on the DocuSign Demo system with XML and JSON request and response samples.
