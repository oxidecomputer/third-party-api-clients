     * Gets the default Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure for an envelope.
     *
     * This function performs a `GET` to the `/v2.1/accounts/{accountId}/envelopes/{envelopeId}/recipients/{recipientId}/consumer_disclosure` endpoint.
     *
     * Retrieves the default, HTML-formatted Electronic Record and Signature Disclosure (ERSD) for the envelope that you specify.
     *
     * This is the default ERSD disclosure that DocuSign provides for the convenience of U.S.-based customers only. This default disclosure is only valid for transactions between U.S.-based parties.
     *
     * To set the language of the disclosure that you want to retrieve, use the optional `langCode` query parameter.
     *
     * **Parameters:**
     *
     * * `account_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
     * * `envelope_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
     * * `recipient_id: &str` -- A local reference that senders use to map recipients to other objects, such as specific document tabs. Within an envelope, each `recipientId` must be unique, but there is no uniqueness requirement across envelopes. For example, many envelopes assign the first recipient a `recipientId` of `1`.
     * * `lang_code: &str` -- (Optional) The code for the signer language version of the disclosure that you want to retrieve. The following languages are supported:
     *   
     *   - Arabic (`ar`)
     *   - Bulgarian (`bg`)
     *   - Czech (`cs`)
     *   - Chinese Simplified (`zh_CN`)
     *   - Chinese Traditional (`zh_TW`)
     *   - Croatian (`hr`)
     *   - Danish (`da`)
     *   - Dutch (`nl`)
     *   - English US (`en`)
     *   - English UK (`en_GB`)
     *   - Estonian (`et`)
     *   - Farsi (`fa`)

     *   - Norwegian (`no`)
     *   - Polish (`pl`)
     *   - Portuguese (`pt`)
     *   - Portuguese Brazil (`pt_BR`)
     *   - Romanian (`ro`)
