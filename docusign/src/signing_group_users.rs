    * Gets a list of members in a Signing Group.

    *
    * Retrieves the list of members in the specified Signing Group.
    *
    * **Parameters:**
    *
    * * `account_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
    * * `signing_group_id: &str` -- Optional. The ID of the [signing group](https://support.docusign.com/en/guides/ndse-user-guide-signing-groups).
    *   
    *   **Note**: When you send an envelope to a signing group, anyone in the group can open it and sign it with their own signature. For this reason, we recommend that you do not include non-signer recipients (such as carbon copy recipients) in the same signing group as signer recipients. However, you could create a second signing group for the non-signer recipients and change the default action of Needs to Sign to a different value, such as Receives a Copy.
