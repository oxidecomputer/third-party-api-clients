     * Locks an envelope.

     *
     * This method locks the specified envelope and sets the time until
     * the lock expires to prevent other users or recipients from
     * changing the envelope.
     *
     * **Note**: To use this method, the envelope locking
     * capability must be enabled for the user; that is, the user setting
     * `canLockEnvelopes` must be set to **true**.
     *

     * ### The X-DocuSign-Edit header
     *
     * The `X-DocuSign-Edit` header looks like this
     * and can be specified in either JSON or XML.
     *
     * **JSON**
     * ```
     * {
     *   "LockToken": "token-from-response",
     *   "LockDurationInSeconds": "600"
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * **XML**
     * ```
     * <DocuSignEdit>
     *   <LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken>
     *   <LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds>
     * </DocuSignEdit>
     * ```
     *
     * In the actual HTTP header, you would remove the linebreaks:
     *
     * ```
     * X-DocuSign-Edit: {"LockToken": "token-from-response", "LockDurationInSeconds": "600" }
     *     or
     * X-DocuSign-Edit:<DocuSignEdit><LockToken>token-from-response</LockToken><LockDurationInSeconds>600</LockDurationInSeconds></DocuSignEdit>
     * ```
     *
     *
     *
     *
     * **Parameters:**
     *
     * * `account_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
     * * `envelope_id: &str` -- The brand that envelope recipients see when a brand is not explicitly set.
